Qn: Using flutter and flutter redux, I want to call a specific function in a sibling widget to run when a button in another sibling is run

In Flutter, widgets are immutable and their states can't be directly manipulated by sibling or parent widgets. However, you can use a shared state management solution like Redux to achieve this.

Here's an example of how you can do it:

Let's say you have two sibling widgets: `WidgetA` and `WidgetB`. `WidgetA` has a button and when it's pressed, you want a function in `WidgetB` to run.

Firstly, define your actions and reducers:

```dart
// Action
class CallFunctionAction {}

// Reducer
AppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {
  if (action is CallFunctionAction) {
    return AppState(shouldCallFunction: true);
  }
  return state;
}
```

Then, in `WidgetA`, dispatch the `CallFunctionAction` when the button is pressed:

```dart
class WidgetA extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreConnector<AppState, ViewModel>(
      converter: (store) => ViewModel.create(store),
      builder: (context, viewModel) => RaisedButton(
        onPressed: viewModel.onButtonPressed,
        child: Text('Press me'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In `WidgetB`, listen for changes in the `shouldCallFunction` field and call the function when it changes:

```dart
class WidgetB extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreConnector<AppState, ViewModel>(
      converter: (store) => ViewModel.create(store),
      onDidChange: (viewModel) {
        if (viewModel.shouldCallFunction) {
          _callMyFunction();
          // Reset the flag in the store after calling the function
          store.dispatch(ResetCallFunctionAction());
        }
      },
      builder: (context, viewModel) => Container(),
    );
  }

  void _callMyFunction() {
    // Your function logic here
  }
}
```

This way, when the button in `WidgetA` is pressed, it will update the Redux store, which will trigger the function in `WidgetB`.
